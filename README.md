# KIDS23-Team6 - Visualization and prediction of HPC resource utilization

This purpose of this project is to visualize the historical resource usage of the HPCF resources and predict the future usage. We're focusing on the CPU core and memory usage in this effort.

The aim is to provide a dashboard which displays the following based on user selection:

- Historical usage trends.
- Current usage of the cluster queues.
- A prediction of future usage of the cluster queues.

# KIDS23-Team6 - Visualization and prediction of HPC resource utilization

This purpose of this project is to visualize the historical resource usage of the HPCF resources and predict the future usage. Our efforts focus on CPU, GPU, and memory utilization and prediction.

The aim is to summarize historical data, provide useful forecasts of utilization, and ultimately to provide a dashboard which displays these results interactively. 

- Historical usage trends.
- Current usage of the cluster queues.
- A prediction of future usage of the cluster queues.
